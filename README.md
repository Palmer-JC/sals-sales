# Sal's Sales
This is the final resting place of the textures, blend files, and Javascript source files used for the "Sals Pre-owned Spacecraft Sales" parity commercial / site.  No additional work, or PRs, are planned for this repository.  Enjoy!

#### Caveats
The BabylonJS file being loaded is not a static version.  It will be the latest production version available into the future.  This was done, because WebXR multiview is not currently operational, but this scene has been coded to use it.  This might help older devices like the Quest 1 when this becomes available.  If a future version of BabylonJS causes the scene to fail for whatever reason, the `index.html` will be changed to use the last static version which did work.

## Star Fury
There is just no project without the [Star Fury model](https://www.blendswap.com/blends/view/73521), from Chris Kuhn / Kuhn Industries.  The published Blender 2.57 file still loads, but is not really functional. Fortunately, you can append objects from a .blend file into a 3.0 era .blend file.  This rescued that wildly elaborate Geometry from clutches of time.

The materials just needed to be tossed, though.  Time had not been kind to them.  Modern PBR materials were fashioned as a replacement.  The mesh breakout, parent-child relationships, and mesh origins needed to be reorganized in order to be able to open / close the hatch, and animate those fin things in the back.

Notes:
-	The fins are in the .blend file at their maximum rotation.
-	No Triangles were removed or otherwise harmed in the process.

## Space Texture
This texture came from Hdrlabs with the creators being Blochi using data from NASA.  The closest thing to a url is [http://www.hdrlabs.com/sibl/archive.html](http://www.hdrlabs.com/sibl/archive.html).  Look for the Milkyway.  As this is a very large texture, I converted to ASTC format.  May help frame rate performance of older devices like Quest 1.

## Audio
Got portions of sounds for the firing of weapons and the engine sound.  The elevator ding is used un-cropped.

- Firing sound came from "[Scifi Laser Gun Firing](https://freesound.org/s/495054/)" by [TannerSound](https://freesound.org/people/TannerSound/).
- Engine sound came from "[Spaceship Ambience](https://freesound.org/s/234316/)" by [nick121087](https://freesound.org/people/nick121087/).
- Ding sound came from "[Elevator_Ping_01](https://freesound.org/s/459349/)" by [MATRIXXX_](https://freesound.org/people/MATRIXXX_/).

## Babylon 5, The TV Show
None of this could have happened without all the work of those involved in producing Babylon 5.  Salute!
